		We are a growing Chennai based company and we got
		 our start by selling furniture five years ago from our garage.
		  This ensures that when you order furniture for your lounge or dining room
		   from UrbanWood , we know that we can deliver not only quality furniture
		    but the service to go with it. That sounds like it comes at a price. We dont 
		     aim to be the cheapest, but we do aim to be your favourite furniture retailer,
		      inspiring you with intelligent styling and design to make your furniture work  
		      for your busy home life. Essentially UrbanWood provides you with a choice 
		      of quality furniture for your lounge and dining at value prices. Your purchase 
		      will be confirmed by e-mail so that you have a written record of your purchase 
		      and you can even track your order online. UrbanWood website has a secure
		      basket, we dont believe in sending you off to a third party site for your payment 
		      to be processed and we dont store your card details anywhere. For any further 
		      details please feel free to email us .</h3></div>
